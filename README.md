### Description:

Learning about the API using ASP.Net

I decided to play around with API’s and practising ASP.NET. The point of this project was to get used to everything within ASP and understand how API’s work.

I built a test project that would only show data just because I wanted to understand how API’s worked within ASP and how you could use this information with tools such as Postman. The project doesn’t allow the user to add any data or remove any data. However, you can add data via using Postman.

I used Postman to view the data in either XML or JSON. I learnt about how API work using the RESTFUL API. 

I didn’t add any unit testing to the project. The whole point of this exercise was to remember and understand the basic concepts of API’s.
If you want to see data, then load up the project in any web browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox) and then where the URL link is go next to it and type in this “/API/Person” (Without the “”) then press enter then you can see the data in XML.

### What I learnt: 
- Learnt about RESTFUL-API
- Researched about SOAP
- Learnt about ASP.Net
- Increased knowledge on Razor
- Further understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- How to use postman to check headers
- Better understanding of JSON and XML
